# Part 5: Compass and Object Oriented SASS

## Compass
Compass is an add on to SASS that allows you to organize your SCSS and CSS files in seperate folders and, keep track of changes from a specific SCSS file to CSS
When I was using Compass to start creating my app, I spent less time trying to find a file since everything was organized clearly and I was able to look at my changes from 
my CSS file.

### How to install Compass
Before you install compass in your workspace, you first need to install SASS and cd to your project folder. After that, use `gem install compass`. Once you install compass, you will 
get two folders in your project folder. One folder has SCSS files and the other folder has CSS files.
